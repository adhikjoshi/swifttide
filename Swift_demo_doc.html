</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Let&rsquo;s
get started.  Let&rsquo;s login as admin, assuming we are a new user.
 Point your browser to the demo site (unless you&rsquo;ve been
instructed differently the demo site is </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://demo.swifttide.com/">http://demo.swifttide.com</A></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
admin username is admin, and the password is _______.  (You should
have been provided this information, as it changes often).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>You
should now see the main administration menu down the left hand side
of the screen.  Let&rsquo;s set some factory defaults.  Click on
Table Maintenance.  Note how once you do this the screen changes to
tell you that you are in Admin Table Maintenance.  It&rsquo;s hard to
get lost inside Command School!  Now choose Configuration.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This
is where you set the default login message (in this case, the
principal has advised his staff to check the site first thing in the
morning for cancellations, and he posted that school is indeed
cancelled due to poor weather).  He posted an inspiring message to
his Teachers, and a message to parents to see when they login.  Since
we manage the Indianapolis, Kentucky school district, we don&rsquo;t
want to have to type that 5,000 times for the 5,000 kids we need to
input.  So we tell Command School that &ldquo;unless we type
something different, the city is Indianapolis, the state is Kentucky,
and the zip code is 55555&rdquo;.  You can also set a default entry
date (which says &ldquo;unless we tell you differently, the date of
entry for this student is 01/01/01&rdquo; or whatever date you might
choose.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Let&rsquo;s
click on School Names.  Here we&rsquo;ve got our 3 schools in the
district listed.  It&rsquo;s simple to add another, simply type it in
the box and click Add.  If a school name should change, just click
edit in the table above and change its name.  You can remove schools,
but there must be no information tied to that school, or the system
will not let you remove it.  This prevents overworked administrators
from making innocent but devastating mistakes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Managing
Ethnic codes is just as easy.  In fact, one of the most popular
feedbacks we get on Command School is that once a user figured out
how to do one thing, he or she could easily apply it to the rest of
the program.  Click on Ethnicities and you&rsquo;ll see what we mean.
 Need to add a new Ethnic code?  Type it in and click Add.  Want to
change one?  Click Edit.  Need to remove one?  Click remove.  It&rsquo;s
all that easy through the whole program!  </FONT></FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>You&rsquo;re

<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>We

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Grade
Comments, Attendance Codes, Infraction Codes, Generations (Jr. Sr.
3<SUP>rd</SUP>, etc.) and Titles (Mr., Mrs. Dr., etc.) are all the
same and allow people inputting the student data to minimize typing
errors.  </FONT></FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>

<P CLASS="western">When was the last time you dealt with software
that had all the settings you needed?  Never!  So <U>we made it
possible for you to add an UNLIMITED number of custom fields</U> to
Command School!</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Some
schools use fields like &ldquo;ESL (English as a Second Language) or
Title I, or AfterSchool Homework Club.  Any piece of data you want to
store is so easy, just add a field name and you&rsquo;re ready to go.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Under
Health Codes, is the same format.  Add codes for Office Codes
(reasons for office visits, like Felt Sick, Black Eye, Stomach Ache,
etc.), Immunization Codes, Allergy Codes, and any Medications that
the student might be on.  Adding fields is as simple as typing in a
name and clicking Add, editing them is as simple as clicking on Edit,
and removing them just requires you to click on remove.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Now,
click on Main Admin Menu under Main Menu to go back to the main
administration menu.  Now, we&rsquo;re ready to see some kids in the
system!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>What&rsquo;s
the easiest way to find students in your database?  Anyway you
choose!</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>So
Command School allows you to search for students based on ID number,
or Last Name, or School, Home Schooled, Special Ed, any different
number of ways!  So let&rsquo;s see a typical student.  Since you are
new to our district, and you just got a harried call about needing
information about a student (you didn&rsquo;t catch the full name,
but the last name began with a J and the first name sounded like
Dustin), we need to be creative!  Let&rsquo;s not bother the caller
to please clarify who they want, we&rsquo;ll let Command School find
it for us!  Click on Manage Students, and then click the letter J
under &ldquo;Display by Last name Initial&rdquo;.  Note how we have
three students, and the last one in the list is Dustin Jirvin.  Click
Select to view details on Dustin.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Need
to add another contact for Dustin?  Just click Add Contact.  Note how
the Primary Contact is displayed, and if this is the student&rsquo;s
residence the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; is displayed in red.  With
just a quick glance, we know Dustin&rsquo;s Teacher, birthdate, main
phone numbers, who he&rsquo;s living with, etc.  Let&rsquo;s add
another contact.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Command
School allows an unlimited number of contacts for each student!</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>So,
let&rsquo;s add a new contact for Dustin.  Click the Add Contact
button.  Here&rsquo;s the familiar &ldquo;fill in this information
screen.&rdquo;  But what if one of Dustin&rsquo;s contacts is already
in the system?  Let&rsquo;s see!  Dustin&rsquo;s other contact is
Robert Knoliston.  So type Knoliston in the box that says &ldquo;Or
Choose Contact from Database: Last Name&rdquo;.  Then click search. 
There&rsquo;s Robert Knoliston.  Select a relation (how is Robert
related to Dustin, let&rsquo;s choose Uncle).  And this isn&rsquo;t
Dustin&rsquo;s residence so we won&rsquo;t check off the residence
box.  Now click Select.  Click OK on the box that comes up.  Just
like that, you&rsquo;ve added a contact to a student.  Imagine a
parent with 5 or 6 kids in the school, and each student has 3 or 4
contacts.  Under most Student Information Systems, you&rsquo;ll be
typing for a while!  With Command School, we take away the tedious
tasks and allow you to spend your time managing schools!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Note
that in the next screen, we are asked if we wish to add this user as
a &ldquo;web user&rdquo;.   Doing so would allow Robert the ability
to login and check on Dustin's attendance and discipline events.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Let's

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>One

those, and click Details to view the details of one of the visits. 
You can do the same thing with medications, and immunizations as well

Math here at Seatown Elementary.  Choose Seatown Elementary from the

a button or menu on your email client that says &ldquo;Send and

every ten minutes.  If you open the message, it should say something
similar to &ldquo;A new discipline note has been added for Duston
